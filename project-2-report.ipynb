    "This comprehensive report aims to conduct a thorough investigation into three crucial aspects of the asthma disease. This report will primarily focus on the cities in Scotland with the highest population, namely Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee [1]. Reportedly, there has been a surge in respiratory diseases after the COVID-19 pandemic [2]. To analyse the after-effects of COVID-19 on respiratory health, the scope of this report is limited to data from 2019-2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we will be examining which city, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee, has the highest number of asthma patients. This analysis will help us gain valuable insights into the prevalence of asthma in these areas. Additionally, we will conduct an analysis to determine the age group that is most impacted by asthma. Finally, the report will explore the gender-based analysis of asthma prevalence, specifically comparing male and female populations. The goal is to identify any noteworthy variations in asthma disease between genders.\n"

    "This bar chart compares whether there are differences in asthma among three major cities in Scotland. The horizontal axis represents the city, and the vertical axis represents the number of asthma patients. We found that in the four years 2019 to 2022, Edinburgh has the highest number of asthma patients, followed by Aberdeen, and Dundee has the lowest number. Based on the bar chart, it is reasonable to speculate that urban environments could have a substantial impact on the prevalence of asthma. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that the population size exhibits a consistent trend, with Edinburgh having the highest population, followed by Aberdeen and then Dundee. This observation indicate that demographic factors, which may be related to urbanisation could be influencing the different rates of asthma in these regions."

    "The above line indicates the relationship between the number of asthma patients in different age groups in the three major cities. The horizontal axis represents the age group of patients, and the vertical axis represents the number of patients. In our observations, we have noticed that the prevalence of asthma differs across cities, but there are commonalities in the age groups affected by this condition. The number of patients in the three major cities of the youth (00-19) and elderly (75-85 plus) is relatively low, and the number of patients increases with age in the youth and decreases with age in the elderly. In all three major cities, there is a significant number of patients between the ages of 50 and 59. It appears that asthma may be influenced by age, suggesting a potential correlation between the two."

Normalising the data allows for a better understanding, as the disease can be studied more holistically across the three cities. Additionally, this will provide a more comprehensive view of the age groups that are the most disproportionately impacted across Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee. For a more balanced viewpoint, we also decided to expand the age gap from 5 to 10. As an example, the age groups will be updated to include a broader range, from 00-09, rather than previous breakdown of 00-04 and 05-09. In addition, we will create a new age group of 70+ by combining the age range of 70 to 85 plus."
